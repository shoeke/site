                    <p class="support-text">Forms received between January 1 and 26 are mailed on a weekly basis. Forms received between January 27 and the due date (January 31, or the next business day by 3:00 PM EST) are guaranteed to be postmarked by the due date. In February, we resume weekly mailing. Recipients should receive their copies within 5-7 business day after mailing.</p>
                    <p class="support-text">If you ordered the TIN Checking add-on service, we perform the TIN check before mailing recipient statements. If the TIN check fails, we let you know and hold the statements until the TIN check is successful. To avoid a late penalty around the deadline, we have to mail out all statements, even if TIN check was not successful. If we mail out a statement with a failed TIN check, you will have to file a correction to change the TIN. If the IRS TIN check service is not available, it may affect our ability to mail out paper statements. To avoid any late penalty, we reserve the right to mail paper statements before TIN check is complete.</p>
                    <p class="support-text">If you have provided us with a recipient’s email, deliver their statements electronically. We wait three days for the recipient to accept e-delivery. If the recipient does not accept e-delivery, we mail out a paper copy. As we approach the deadline, and if we cannot wait for the recipient’s acceptance, we mail out paper statements.</p>
                    <p class="support-text">If recipients’ accept e-delivery, they can access their forms right after away.</p>
